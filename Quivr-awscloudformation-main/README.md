This repository will consists of Cloud Formation templated created for Quivr App deployment in AWS. The Cloud Formation Templates are created using ASecureCloud Web Interface. 

## AWS Cloud Formation Template using ASecureCloud Interface
AWS CloudFormation service makes it possible to automatically deploy and manage AWS resources using templates. Users can describe resources and their parameters in a JSON or YAML template file to create infrastructure as code. The resources are then created and managed by CloudFormation, which makes it simpler to maintain and duplicate infrastructure in an effective and consistent way.
Let's see how AWS CloudFormation Templates can be easily created with the help of ASecureCloud Platform.
